        <h2>What Caused the Hindenburg Crash?</h2>
        <img src="hindenburg_crash.jpg" alt="Hindenburg disaster">
        <p>What caused the Hindenburg Crash is still unknown; however, the most widely accepted theory is that static electricity caused leaking hydrogen gas to catch fire, resulting in the airship combusting. Joanna Walters from The Guardian stated that “a spark of static electricity had most likely ignited leaking hydrogen […] from one of the ship’s rear gas containers” (Walters 2). A spark of static electricity caused a leak to suddenly catch fire. This is the most widely accepted theory because of the weather conditions during the crash...</p>

        <h2>Consequences of the Hindenburg Disaster</h2>
        <img src="zeppelin.jpg" alt="Zeppelin airship">
        <p>The Hindenburg disaster had serious consequences, leading to a huge stop in Zeppelin production and the decline of airship travel. Michael Leidig from the Daily Telegraph stated that “Zeppelin production was halted soon after the tragedy in May 1937 when the mighty Hindenburg—the largest aircraft ever to fly—burst into flames while landing in a storm at Lakenhurst, New Jersey” (Leidig 1). Zepplin travel had severely stopped after the Hindenburg disaster due to fear of another accident...</p>

        <h2>Improvements After the Disaster</h2>
        <img src="modern_zeppelin.jpg" alt="Modern Zeppelin NT">
        <p>Following the Hindenburg disaster, significant changes were made to ensure that such a disaster would never happen again. One of the biggest changes was the replacement of highly flammable hydrogen with nonflammable helium, making modern airships far safer. Corinne LaBalme from The New York Times stated that “The New Technology Zeppelin, or Zeppelin NT, is filled with nonflammable helium instead of hydrogen and can climb to 7,875 feet” (LaBalme 1)...</p>
